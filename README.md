# SegmentModel Spy

SegmentModel Spy is a an interactive visualization tool for
[GATK](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/)'s CNV segmentation results. In
practice, it does (almost) all that
[PlotModeledSegments](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037593891-PlotModeledSegments)
does but with steroids. Under the hood, Segment-Model Spy uses
[GenomeSpy](https://github.com/tuner/genome-spy) for WebGL-based rendering.

A live version is available at https://genomespy.app/segmentmodel/
