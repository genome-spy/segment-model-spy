# SegmentModel Spy

SegmentModel Spy is a an interactive visualization tool for
[GATK](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/)'s
[copy-number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_number_variation) segmentation
results. In practice, it does (almost) all that
[PlotModeledSegments](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037593891-PlotModeledSegments)
does but adds continuous panning and zooming and provides a few annotation
tracks. Under the hood, SegmentModel Spy uses
[GenomeSpy](https://github.com/genome-spy/genome-spy) for WebGL-based rendering.
This tool is also an example of how to use GenomeSpy in a web application.

An online version is available at https://genomespy.app/segmentmodel/
